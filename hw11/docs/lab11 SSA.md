Make LLVM programs into SSA form. 

a. Assume input is a AS_instrList, without prolog and epilog structures. 

b. After converting AS_instrList into SSA, you need to use the AS_splice to put each method (along with their prolog and epilog) into one AS_instrList, and print them with .ll file. Such a .ll can be executed via lli command. 

c.The code generated by this lab can be run using llvm, and the results of the run will become the main scoring criteria for this lab.

d. We encourage you to use your previous experience to complete this lab, which will help you understand how the code works.

e. All you need to do is to complete 3 funtion:

+ Find the dominance frontier of each node
+ Place phi function
+ Rename temp
