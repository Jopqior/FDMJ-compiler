# Homework Assignment #5

You need to write  for a parser (called parser0) for the FDMJ2024 grammar. The grammar is given under hw3_4/doc.

Your parser is to generate an AST structure (using the fdmjast.h given under hw3_4/include/utils/dsa), and print out the XML representation of the AST structure (or the FDMJ source file).

In addition, your parser should handle at least 3 different kinds of syntax errors as discussed in class. In your report, you need to specify the kind of errors you handle, and the method(s) that handle them.

Hand in your code by using "make handin" and submit the package on elearning.
