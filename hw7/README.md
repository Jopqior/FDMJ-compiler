# Homework Assignment #7

Translate AST to TigerIR+ (part I)

This assignment translates FDMJ AST (without arrays and classes) to TigerIR+. Files are under repo/hw7. Your code will load the AST from XML format using the xml2ast code under lib/utils/printer.

Some test fmj files are under hw7/test. You may use the fmj2ast program under hw5/vendor/tools to generate more AST XML files for your own tests.

As usual, do all your work with the class code repository and submit to elearning the materials packaged with "make handin".
