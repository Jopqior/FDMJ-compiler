# Homework Assignment #8

Translate AST to TigerIR+ (part II)

This assignment translates FDMJ AST ( **WITH**  arrays and classes) to TigerIR+. Files are under repo/hw8. Your code will load the AST from XML format using the xml2ast code under lib/utils/printer.

The code has already included linearization and tracing on your final IR tree. You may check the IR-tree printout and the printout after linearization and tracing.

Some test fmj and their corresponding xml files are under hw8/test. You may use the fmj2ast program under hw5/vendor/tools to generate more AST XML files for your own tests.

As usual, do all your work with the class code repository and submit to elearning the materials packaged with "make handin".
